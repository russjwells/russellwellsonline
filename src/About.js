              I began programming when I was young. In middle school I learned Basic on the TI-83, then HTML from Neopets and began to create my own geocities sites. In high school I took all the programming courses available and created an independent study. Before graduation I had AP computer science credit and a working knowledge of Visual Basic, C, C#, and Java, as well as HTML, CSS, PHP and mySQL.

              I was accepted into and enrolled in the Digtal Design program in DAAP at the University of Cincinnati. I spent the first year in design fundementals learning the theories of color form and space, the principals of organization, and the elements of design. In my second year I began working extensively in Flash and Actionscript 3, started picking up Javascript, learned jQuery, and some animation libaries. I worked in Venice, CA at a Motion Graphics studio over the Summer. In my third year I lead development on several Flash based apps for smartphones, and founded my first startup.
